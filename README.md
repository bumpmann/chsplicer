Node.js: chsplicer
=================

`chsplicer` a song splicer / customizer for clone hero. This can pick any parts, make loops and so on for godlike trainings.

You can point source songs from:
 - a relative path from clone hero song folder
 - a song on chorus by its md5 (this will download the song).
 - an url of a song archive (zip / rar)

Installation
------------

    npm install -g chsplicer

Usage
-----

    chsplicer run ./examples/destiny.json

    chsplicer runall ./examples

Prerequisites
-------------

#### ffmpeg

chsplicer requires ffmpeg to work.

If the `FFMPEG_PATH` environment variable is set, chsplicer will use it as the full path to the `ffmpeg` executable.  Otherwise, it will attempt to call `ffmpeg` directly (so it should be in your `PATH`).

**Windows users**: most probably ffmpeg will _not_ be in your `%PATH`, so you _must_ set `%FFMPEG_PATH`

**Debian/Ubuntu users**: the official repositories have the ffmpeg executable in the `libav-tools` package, and they are actually rebranded avconv/avprobe executables (avconv is a fork of ffmpeg).  They should be mostly compatible, but should you encounter any issue, you may want to use the real ffmpeg instead. You can either compile it from source or find a pre-built .deb package at https://ffmpeg.org/download.html (For Ubuntu, the `ppa:mc3man/trusty-media` PPA provides recent builds).

Current limitations
-----

- I did not test to mix songs with different sampling
- This only uses expert guitar track
